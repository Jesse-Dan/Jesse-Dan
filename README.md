I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer building **scalable systems** with a focus on backend architecture, cross-platform mobile development, and AI integration.

For the past few years, I've been working with Laravel, Spring Boot, Nest.js, Ktor, and Flutter—helping teams ship production-grade applications across web, mobile, and cloud platforms.

I was a member of **Google Developer Student Clubs** and continue exploring cutting-edge tech in AI agents, embedded systems, and DevOps.

**My passion** is building robust backend systems and intuitive mobile experiences that solve real problems. I'm currently diving deep into **Embedded C++**, **iOS Native Development**, and **Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM)**.

## 💼 My Work

I do all kinds of work to help people get started with modern tech stacks or scale existing solutions:

### 🛠️ **Backend Engineering** — Laravel, Spring Boot, Nest.js, Ktor, Dart Frog
Building RESTful APIs, microservices architectures, and real-time systems with proper authentication, caching strategies, and database optimization.

### 📱 **Mobile Development** — Flutter, Kotlin, KMM, iOS
Creating cross-platform applications that deliver native performance. From state management to platform channels, I handle the full mobile stack.

### 🌐 **Frontend Development** — React, Vue
Designing responsive, user-friendly interfaces that integrate seamlessly with backend services.

### 🤖 **AI & DevOps** — AI Agents, Docker, CI/CD
Implementing intelligent automation, containerized deployments, and continuous integration pipelines for reliable software delivery.
